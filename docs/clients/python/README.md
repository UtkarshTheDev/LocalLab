## üì¶ Installation

Install the client package:

```bash
pip install locallab-client
```

> **Note**: The package name is `locallab-client` but the import is `locallab_client` (with an underscore)

## üöÄ Quick Start

The LocalLab client provides two different client classes:

1. `LocalLabClient` - An asynchronous client that uses `async`/`await` syntax
2. `SyncLocalLabClient` - A synchronous client that doesn't require `async`/`await`

Choose the one that best fits your needs.

### Synchronous Usage

Use `SyncLocalLabClient` when you don't want to use async/await:

```python
from locallab_client import SyncLocalLabClient

# Initialize client
client = SyncLocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000")

try:
    # Basic text generation - no async/await needed!
    response = client.generate("Write a story about a robot")
    print(response)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Generation failed: {str(e)}")
finally:
    # Close the client - no async/await needed!
    client.close()
```

### Asynchronous Usage

Use `LocalLabClient` when you're working with async code:

```python
import asyncio
from locallab_client import LocalLabClient

async def main():
    # Initialize client
    client = LocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000")

    try:
        # Basic text generation
        response = await client.generate("Write a story about a robot")
        print(response)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Generation failed: {str(e)}")
    finally:
        await client.close()

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Context Manager Support

Both clients support context managers for automatic resource cleanup:

```python
# Import the clients
from locallab_client import SyncLocalLabClient, LocalLabClient

# Synchronous context manager
with SyncLocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000") as client:
    response = client.generate("Write a story about a robot")
    print(response)
# Client is automatically closed

# Asynchronous context manager
async with LocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000") as client:
    response = await client.generate("Write a story about a robot")
    print(response)
# Client is automatically closed
```

## üìö API Reference

### Client Initialization

#### Asynchronous Client

```python
from locallab_client import LocalLabClient

client = LocalLabClient(
    base_url: str,
    timeout: float = 30.0,
    auto_close: bool = True  # Automatically close inactive sessions
)

# Note: The package name is 'locallab-client' but the import is 'locallab_client'
# pip install locallab-client
```

#### Synchronous Client

```python
from locallab_client import SyncLocalLabClient

client = SyncLocalLabClient(
    base_url: str,
    timeout: float = 30.0
)

# Note: The package name is 'locallab-client' but the import is 'locallab_client'
# pip install locallab-client
```

> **Feature**: Both clients automatically close inactive sessions and provide proper resource management. The synchronous client handles all the async/await details internally.

### Text Generation

#### Basic Generation

```python
# Async usage with LocalLabClient
response = await client.generate(
    prompt: str,
    model_id: str = None,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_length: int = None,
    top_p: float = 0.9
) -> str

# Sync usage with SyncLocalLabClient
response = client.generate(
    prompt: str,
    model_id: str = None,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_length: int = None,
    top_p: float = 0.9
) -> str
```

#### Streaming Generation

```python
# Async usage with LocalLabClient
async for token in client.stream_generate(
    prompt: str,
    model_id: str = None,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_length: int = None,
    top_p: float = 0.9,
    timeout: float = 60.0  # Control request timeout
):
    print(token, end="", flush=True)

# Sync usage with SyncLocalLabClient
for token in client.stream_generate(
    prompt: str,
    model_id: str = None,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_length: int = None,
    top_p: float = 0.9,
    timeout: float = 60.0
):
    print(token, end="", flush=True)
```

### Chat Completion

```python
# Async usage with LocalLabClient
response = await client.chat(
    messages: list[dict],
    model_id: str = None,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_length: int = None,
    top_p: float = 0.9
) -> dict

# Sync usage with SyncLocalLabClient
response = client.chat(
    messages: list[dict],
    model_id: str = None,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_length: int = None,
    top_p: float = 0.9
) -> dict
```

Example:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
]

# Async usage with LocalLabClient
response = await client.chat(messages)
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])

# Sync usage with SyncLocalLabClient
response = client.chat(messages)
print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
```

### Batch Generation

```python
# Async usage with LocalLabClient
responses = await client.batch_generate(
    prompts: list[str],
    model_id: str = None,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_length: int = None,
    top_p: float = 0.9
) -> dict

# Sync usage with SyncLocalLabClient
responses = client.batch_generate(
    prompts: list[str],
    model_id: str = None,
    temperature: float = 0.7,
    max_length: int = None,
    top_p: float = 0.9
) -> dict
```

Example:

```python
prompts = [
    "Write a haiku",
    "Tell a joke",
    "Give a fun fact"
]

# Async usage with LocalLabClient
responses = await client.batch_generate(prompts)
for prompt, response in zip(prompts, responses["responses"]):
    print(f"\nPrompt: {prompt}")
    print(f"Response: {response}")

# Sync usage with SyncLocalLabClient
responses = client.batch_generate(prompts)
for prompt, response in zip(prompts, responses["responses"]):
    print(f"\nPrompt: {prompt}")
    print(f"Response: {response}")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Connection Errors

If you can't connect to the server, make sure it's running and accessible:

```python
# Async usage with LocalLabClient
try:
    await client.generate("Test")
except ConnectionError as e:
    print("Server not running:", str(e))

# Sync usage with SyncLocalLabClient
try:
    client.generate("Test")
except ConnectionError as e:
    print("Server not running:", str(e))
```

#### 2. Timeout Handling

For slow responses or large generations, increase the timeout:

```python
# For async client initialization
client = LocalLabClient(
    "http://localhost:8000",
    timeout=60.0  # 60 seconds timeout
)

# For sync client initialization
client = SyncLocalLabClient(
    "http://localhost:8000",
    timeout=60.0  # 60 seconds timeout
)

# For streaming requests
for token in client.stream_generate("Hello", timeout=120.0):
    print(token, end="")
```

#### 3. Memory Management

For low-resource environments, unload models when not in use:

```python
# Async usage with LocalLabClient
async def memory_warning(usage: float):
    print(f"High memory usage: {usage}%")
    await client.unload_model()

client.on_memory_warning = memory_warning

# Sync usage with SyncLocalLabClient
def memory_warning(usage: float):
    print(f"High memory usage: {usage}%")
    client.unload_model()

client.on_memory_warning = memory_warning
```

#### 4. Resource Management

Always close clients when done to prevent resource leaks:

```python
# Sessions are automatically closed when the client is garbage collected
# or when the program exits, but you should still close them explicitly:

# Async usage with LocalLabClient
await client.close()

# Sync usage with SyncLocalLabClient
client.close()

# Or better yet, use context managers for automatic closing:

# Async context manager
async with LocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000") as client:
    # Do something with the client
    pass  # Session is automatically closed when exiting the block

# Sync context manager
with SyncLocalLabClient("http://localhost:8000") as client:
    # Do something with the client
    pass  # Session is automatically closed when exiting the block
```

#### 5. Package Installation Issues

If you encounter import errors, make sure you've installed the correct package:

```bash
pip install locallab-client
```

And import it correctly:

```python
# The package name is 'locallab-client' but the import is 'locallab_client'
from locallab_client import LocalLabClient
from locallab_client import SyncLocalLabClient
```
