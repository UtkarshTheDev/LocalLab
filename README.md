# 🚀 LocalLab: Your Personal AI Lab

LocalLab lets you run AI language models on your computer or Google Colab - no cloud services needed! Think of it as having ChatGPT-like capabilities right on your machine.

## 🤔 What is LocalLab?

LocalLab consists of two parts working together:

    A[LocalLab Server] -->|Runs| B[AI Models]
    C[Your Code] -->|Uses| D[LocalLab Client] -->|Talks to| A
```

### The Server (Your AI Engine)

Think of the server as your personal AI engine. It:

- Downloads and runs AI models on your computer
- Manages memory and resources automatically
- Optimizes performance based on your hardware
- Provides a simple API for accessing models

You can run it:

- On your computer (local mode)
- On Google Colab (free GPU mode)

### The Client (Your AI Controller)

The client is how your code talks to the AI. It:

- Connects to your LocalLab server
- Sends requests for text generation
- Handles chat conversations
- Processes multiple requests at once
- Streams responses in real-time

## ✨ How It Works Together

When you use LocalLab:

1. **Server Setup**

   ```python
   from locallab import start_server
   start_server()  # Server starts and loads AI model
   ```

2. **Client Connection**

   ```python
   from locallab.client import LocalLabClient
   server_url = "http://localhost:8000" # or "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.app"
   client = LocalLabClient(server_url)
   ```

3. **AI Interaction**
   ```python
   # Your code sends requests through the client
   response = await client.generate("Write a story")
   print(response)  # Server processes and returns AI response
   ```

## 💡 Quick Examples

```python
# Generate text
response = await client.generate("Hello!")

# Chat with AI
response = await client.chat([
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}
])

# Process multiple prompts
responses = await client.batch_generate([
    "Write a joke",
    "Tell a story"
])
```

## 💻 Requirements

**Local Computer:**

- Python 3.8+
- 4GB RAM minimum
- GPU optional (but recommended)

**Google Colab:**

- Just a Google account!
- Free tier works fine
